## Case study

The SDD consists of 4 separate services within one portfolio that share the same internal user base, it also consists of 4 interaction designers. At the beginning, I was hesitant about using Figma as a tool for GDS designs, advocating for the prototype kit and Gov.uk front end. Nevertheless, I started the library by importing the GDS components and allowing the other 3 designers to create designs for their service, soon enough it became apparent that the framework was good enough to allow the designers to create and explore ideas.

#### GDS Components

Most Departments now have their own components available in both Figma and other design tools, you can find most of them below.</div>

#### Prototype 1

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Even though the first prototype was done, using the prototyping kit, a full copy was created in Figma to allow discourse and critique to be done.

#### Discussions

It became very easy to gather user research and valuable feedback on the board where it created a go to space for such discussions to take place.

#### Prototype 2

Moreover, it saved time; to explore with components and patterns not existing in the Gov.uk frontend it allowed for greater flexibility towards producing a solution that better meets the user needs.
