## A sub-journey

Currently in Phase 4 a user is able to send grouped items to one consignor and consignee. House consignments would allow the user to send multiple grouped items with more than one consignor and consignee within the same declaration. This is sometimes referred to as ‘groupage’.

The research has been around user behaviour and how potentially this would impact the user in their everyday trade. Also obtaining feedback of users expectations around the usage of this new functionality.

This functionality has come from the EU commission and part of the updates for phase 5 considering the operational guidance for member states - ICS2 Operational guidance for Member States 2021.

#### Screenshots

- A radio button option that gives the user the ability to select from the start if the House consignments will be more than one.

#### The declaration summary

At the end of the journey the user is then taken back to the declaration summary where they can see that they have completed this section.
