## Case study

The Academy Transfers service consists of a group of regions. Each region is a geographical location in England that handles communication and management of the transfer of an Academy. At the time this digital service is created, the data for these transfers are stored in a MS Dynamics CRM environment.

It became apparent that this solution was no longer viable for usabilty and other reasons. So a task force was created to explore a few solutions. The solution that was chosen was to build a GDS components styled prototype as the ‘view’, connect it to a minimal set of real data as the ‘model’ through an API to the Dynamics CRM, and finally a Ruby controller that would be replaced with a C# controller at a later stage.

It was critical that we were able to use real data, in order to create a proof of consept in order to move away from the Dynamics CRM. png

The below screeshots were created in a 4 week period from the initial kick-off meeting for this project. The extra time was then used to allow an exploration of different variants found here: [of the concepts main dashboard.](/posts/variants)
