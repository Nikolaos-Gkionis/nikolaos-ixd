### Crime and Punishment

Is a book by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky) A russian novelist whose classical work has been in my parents house since I was little. The second book I read from Dostoevsky and probably my favourite one.

His ability to paint a picture of Raskolnikov's demise is undisputed. What is more true is the realisation of how deep certain actions can scar humans. Trully a great book, ignore the lenght and the language/ time barriers.

#### Amazon description

Dostoyevsky's great novel of damnation and redemption evokes a world where the lines between innocence and corruption, good and evil, blur. It tells the story of Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, who wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret.

He imagines himself to be beyond conventional moral laws. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck.
