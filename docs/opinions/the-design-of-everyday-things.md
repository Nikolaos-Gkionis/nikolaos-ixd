### The design of everday things

Is a book by [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman), an American researcher, professor, and author. Norman is the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego. He is best known for his books on design, especially The Design of Everyday Things. He is also the individual who coined the term UX, user experience. In this book Don takes you by the hand and explains how everything that is not organic or alive, has at some point been designed by someone else. The way he explains design error vs human error is essential in understanding how good design happens.

#### Amazon description

When The Design of Everyday Things was published in 1988, cognitive scientist Don Norman provocatively proposed that the fault lies not in ourselves, but in design that ignores the needs and psychology of people. Fully revised to keep the timeless principles of psychology up to date with ever-changing new technologies, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful appeal for good design, and a reminder of how -- and why -- some products satisfy while others only disappoint.
