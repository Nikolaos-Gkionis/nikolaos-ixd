As my nana told me 'all the pigs have the same face', George Orwell also makes a good argument on his aligory 'The Animal Farm'

### Excerpt

> “Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name "The Manor Farm". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the Ace of Spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two. ”

#### Amazon description

First published in 1945, “Animal Farm” is an allegorical novella by George Orwell that tells the tale of the animal inhabitants of a farm who engage in a rebellion against the farmer in order to usher in a free, equal society. However, their efforts are subverted by a pig called Napoleon who leads them into a brutal dictatorship instead. The story is based upon the 1917 Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union under Stalin, written at a time when Stalin was held in high esteem by the British intelligentsia. An absolute classic of Western literature not to be missed by those with a keen interest in history and politics. Eric Arthur Blair (1903–1950), more commonly known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English journalist, essayist, critic. His work is characterised by an opposition to totalitarianism and biting social commentary, and remains influential in popular culture today.
