### Nikolaos Gkionis

I am a passionate and creative UX designer with experience of working with private companies and government projects in fast paced collaborative environments. As an individual who starts with a pen and paper I work through the full UX process; from research, to service design, prototyping and testing utilising all the elements of a user centred process to create innovative and intuitive experiences. Even though I am very fluent in using design tools, as Figma and Adobe XD; I prefer to work only with code for implementing prototypes.
